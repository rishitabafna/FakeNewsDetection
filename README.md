# **Fake News Detection — Machine Learning Project 📰🤖**

A complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline that detects whether a news article is **real or fake** using NLP techniques and supervised learning models. This project showcases practical data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation skills—exactly what hiring managers expect from an entry-level SDE/Data applicant.

## 🚀 **Overview**

Fake news spreads faster than ever, and manual filtering is impossible at scale.
This project builds a text-classification system that automatically flags misleading news using ML.

The notebook demonstrates:

* Clean preprocessing pipeline
* Multiple ML models compared
* TF-IDF vectorization
* Strong evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
* Clear, visual insights into model performance

---

## 🧠 **Tech Stack**

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK / Regex
* TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle

---

## 📂 **Dataset**

Dataset: **Kaggle Fake News Detection Dataset**
Contains:

* News text
* Headlines

---

## 🔧 **Pipeline**

### **1. Preprocessing**

* Lowercasing
* URL, punctuation, HTML tag removal
* Stopword cleanup
* Word normalization
* TF-IDF vectorization

### **2. Model Training**

Models used:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Gradient Boosting
* Random Forest


### **3. Evaluation**

Metrics included:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score

All results were visualized using bar charts for clean comparison.

## 📊 **Results**

Best-performing model achieved **~99% accuracy**, showing strong reliability for binary text classification.

Key insights:

* Logistic Regression + TF-IDF performed exceptionally well.
* Tree-based models added robustness but were slightly heavier.
* Preprocessing pipeline improved every model’s consistency.
